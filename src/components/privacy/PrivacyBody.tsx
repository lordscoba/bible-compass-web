          In particular, we share Non-Identifying Information (including the
          advertising identifier currently associated with your device) and Log

          technology companies. The data we share with them may include data
          about your device, approximate location, and use of our Applications,
          including IP address, device identifiers and information, Application
          usage data, and purchase data as well as information you provide to us
          when using our Application Such information may be used to send you
          targeted advertisements for products and services that are relevant to
          your interests. In some cases these third parties will also use the
          data that they collect for their own purposes, such as aggregating
          your data with other data they hold in order to inform advertising
          related services provided to other clients. That advertising may
          appear across the Services.{" "}

          For example, we may collect and share the advertising identifier
          associated with your device (such as the Apple IDFA and Android
          Advertising ID) with advertisers. An advertising identifier is an
          alphanumeric string that can be used to identify your device so that
          advertisers can serve relevant ads to you. We use the Apple IDFA only
          as permitted by Apple, and we use the Android Advertising ID only as
          permitted by Google. An advertising identifier is assigned, and ad
          tracking is turned on, by default on your mobile device. You may limit
          the use of or reset your advertising device ID using the privacy
          settings on your mobile device; in some instances you may need to
          reset the operating system to reset the advertising device ID. We do
          not associate any of your personal information with your advertising
          device ID without your consent (which may be given by you in our terms
